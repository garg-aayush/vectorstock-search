This rule applies to whenever I need to add comment to the Atlassian JIRA ticket.
## Structure of the JIRA ticket comment
- The ticket should start with the current date in the format 
  - "## Update <Date> (Comment x/X)"
  - Example "## Update August 14th, 2025 (Comment 1/5)
- Make sure to write the comments in bullet points
- Make sure to do through the following before writing the comment:
  - The ticket description, details, acceptance criteria and implementation plan
  - The given context and instructions
- Make sure to first write the comment for review. When I agree with the structure and content then only add it to the JIRA ticket. 
- Make sure to write the comment locally too to the Ticket.md file
