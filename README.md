## Usage Guide

### Running New Searches

1. **Basic Search Parameters**:
   - **Keywords** (required) - Enter search terms
   - **Category** - Select from VectorStock categories
   - **Artist** - Filter by specific artist name
   - **Page** - Choose page number for pagination
   - **Sort Order** - best match, trending, latest, isolated, or featured
   - **Count Only** - Return only result count (no images)

2. **License & Format Filters**:
   - **Free Only** - Show only free images
   - **Expanded License Only** - Filter expanded license images
   - **Include Editorial** - Include editorial licenses
   - **SVG Only** - Only SVG format files

   - **Popularity Score** - Filter by popularity (1-10)
   - **Artist Score** - Filter by artist score (1-10)

4. **Smart Caching**: The dashboard automatically detects if you've already searched with the same parameters:

   - Shows a notification when using cached results with the original search timestamp
   - Saves API calls and improves response time

5. **Search History**: Use the dropdown to switch between previous search results
   - Shows query, timestamp, page number, and total results
   - ðŸ”„ symbol indicates searches with duplicate parameters (same search run multiple times)
   - Automatically loads the most recent search

### Browsing Results

1. **Main View**: The dashboard displays images from the selected search in a grid layout
2. **Filtering**: Use the sidebar on the left to filter loaded images:
   - Select specific license types
   - Choose an artist or view all
   - Adjust the credits range slider
   - Filter by free/paid status
   - Search for keywords in titles/descriptions
3. **Sorting**: Use the dropdown menu above the image grid to sort results
4. **Image Details**: Click "View Details" on any image to see expanded information
5. **Statistics**: Click the "Statistics" expander to view data visualizations

## Data Format

The dashboard expects search results in JSON format with the following structure:
- `timestamp`: Search timestamp
- `query`: Search query used
- `results`: Object containing:
  - `images`: Array of image objects with art_id, title, description, license, artist, credits, preview URLs, etc.
  - `total`: Total number of results
  - `page`: Current page number
  - `pages`: Total number of pages

## Customization

You can customize the dashboard by modifying `vectorstock_dashboard.py`:
- Change the number of columns in the image grid (default: 4)
- Modify the color scheme in the CSS section
- Add additional filters or sorting options
- Customize the statistics displays

## Troubleshooting

- **Images not loading**: Check your internet connection as images are loaded from VectorStock CDN
- **Dashboard not starting**: Ensure the virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed
- **JSON file not found**: Verify the search results JSON file exists in the expected location

## License

This dashboard is created for internal use to visualize VectorStock search results.
