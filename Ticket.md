## Description

**Ask**

As part of this feature where we give customers the ability to chose a pre-created image from Vectorstock, we want to create an effective filtration system that serves the customer the most accurate and print-friendly images.

**Why**

Vectorstock has a massive catalog of images so we don't want to overwhelm the customer when serving these results to the customer
